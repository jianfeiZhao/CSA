# Computer System Architecture
This repository provides you with an understanding of MIPS instruction set. Several simulators programming with C++ is built to implement the instruction set, includes: 

Processor implementation with a data path and hardwired and microprogrammed control is introduced;

Pipelining is described as a strategy to improve throughput; 

Memory-hierarchy alternatives are introduced to improve the capacity of the computing system;

The concept of virtual memory and its hardware implementation is introduced;

Out-of-order processors, and associated instruction scheduling algorithms and techniques are described and evaluated;

Branch prediction is introduced;

The main memory system is described and pre-fetching is discussed as a technique to improve main memory access latency.

This respository concludes with an introduction to single chip multi-core computing technology.
