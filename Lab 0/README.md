# Lab0
In this lab, you will implement an instruction-level simulator for a single cycle MIPS processor
in C++ step by step. The simulator supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set and can model the execution
of each instruction. Some descriptions and requirements for this lab are in "Lab0.pdf" file. 

What You Have to Do:
1. We have provided skeleton code in the file MIPS.cpp. Finish the code.
2. We have provided a library of test cases containing sample “imem.txt” and “dmem.txt” files
that allow you to test different functions in your MIPS simulator. The imem.txt and dmem.txt
files for the test case you want to run must be placed in the same directory as the source code
before running it.
3. We encourage you to write your own MIPS programs and check your design for different cases.

The solution code are in the file MIPS_solution.cpp.
